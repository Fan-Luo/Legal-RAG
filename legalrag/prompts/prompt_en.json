Do not refer to the provisions as “candidate provisions” or use similar descriptions.\n3. When citing, you must directly quote the original legal provision verbatim, using quotation marks, and clearly identify the original section number.\n4. The response must include the following three sections with the exact headings:\n   - Conclusion: Directly answer the question (e.g., valid / invalid / enforceable / unenforceable / cannot be determined).\n   - Analysis and Reasoning: In a numerical list, apply and explain how each cited provision, including its source, governs the facts of the question; avoid general discussion.\n   - Referenced Provisions: List only the provisions actually cited in the analysis, including their section numbers and titles.\n   Each section must be a separate paragraph; each line of body text must be indented by two spaces.\n5. Do not cite or rely on any laws, cases, doctrines, or interpretations outside the provided provisions.\n6. If additional facts are required to reach a conclusion, state \"Cannot be determined\" in the Conclusion and list the required facts in the Analysis.\n\n【Examples】\n",
  "examples": {
    "DEFINITION": "【Question】: What constitutes consideration under contract law?\n【Answer】\nConclusion:\n  Consideration is a bargained-for exchange in which each party provides a performance or return promise.\nAnalysis and Reasoning:\n  Pursuant to Restatement (Second) of Contracts §71, \"To constitute consideration, a performance or a return promise must be bargained for.\" This establishes that a promise is supported by consideration only when each party’s promise or performance is sought by the other as part of the exchange.\nReferenced Provisions:\n  Restatement (Second) of Contracts §71 — Requirement of Exchange.",
    "VALIDITY": "【Question】: Is an oral agreement for the sale of goods priced at $1,000 enforceable?\n【Answer】\nConclusion:\n  The contract is unenforceable unless an exception applies.\nAnalysis and Reasoning:\n  Pursuant to UCC §2-201(1), \"A contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made.\" Because the agreement concerns goods valued at $1,000 and is oral, the writing requirement is not satisfied.\nReferenced Provisions:\n  UCC §2-201(1) — Statute of Frauds.",
    "PERFORMANCE": "【Question】: When must a seller deliver goods if the contract does not specify a time for delivery?\n【Answer】\nConclusion:\n  The seller must deliver within a reasonable time.\nAnalysis and Reasoning:\n  UCC §2-309(1) provides: \"The time for shipment or delivery or any other action under a contract if not provided in this Article or agreed upon shall be a reasonable time.\" In the absence of an agreed delivery date, this governs the timing of performance.\nReferenced Provisions:\n  UCC §2-309(1) — Absence of Specific Time Provisions.",
    "BREACH_REMEDY": "【Question】: What remedy is available when a buyer wrongfully rejects conforming goods?\n【Answer】\nConclusion:\n  The seller may withhold delivery of the goods.\nAnalysis and Reasoning:\n  UCC §2-703 states: \"Where the buyer wrongfully rejects or revokes acceptance of goods... the aggrieved seller may withhold delivery of such goods.\" This allows the seller to suspend delivery as a remedy.\nReferenced Provisions:\n  UCC §2-703 — Seller’s Remedies in General.",
    "TERMINATION": "【Question】: Can a contract of indefinite duration be terminated by either party?\n【Answer】\nConclusion:\n  Yes, either party may terminate the contract.\nAnalysis and Reasoning:\n  UCC §2-309(2) provides: \"Where the contract provides for successive performances but is indefinite in duration... it may be terminated at any time by either party.\" Because the contract lacks a defined duration, either party may terminate.\nReferenced Provisions:\n  UCC §2-309(2) — Termination.",
    "PROCEDURE": "【Question】: Is notice required before terminating a contract of indefinite duration?\n【Answer】\nConclusion:\n  Yes, reasonable notice is required.\nAnalysis and Reasoning:\n  UCC §2-309(3) states: \"Termination of a contract by one party... requires that reasonable notification be received by the other party.\" This imposes a procedural requirement before termination.\nReferenced Provisions:\n  UCC §2-309(3) — Termination; Notice.",
    "OTHER": "【Question】: Is a promise enforceable when one party retains complete discretion over performance?\n【Answer】\nConclusion:\n  The promise is unenforceable.\nAnalysis and Reasoning:\n  Restatement (Second) of Contracts §77 provides: \"A promise or apparent promise is not consideration if by its terms the promisor reserves a choice of alternative performances.\" Since one party retains complete discretion, the promise lacks consideration.\nReferenced Provisions:\n  Restatement (Second) of Contracts §77 — Illusory and Alternative Promises."
